# Obesity-Levels-Risk-Factors

This project analyzes factors contributing to different obesity categories using machine learning models. For each obesity type, the model ranks features by their importance in predicting the condition, providing insights into key lifestyle and demographic factors.

## 📂 Project Overview
- Input: Dataset containing demographic, lifestyle, and health-related features.
- Output: For each obesity level, the model provides:
  - **Model Accuracy Score**
  - **Feature Importance Ranking** (e.g., Weight – 0.36, Height – 0.28, etc.)
- Purpose: To identify and prioritize the factors most associated with different obesity categories.

## 🏷 Different Types of Obesity
The dataset includes the following obesity categories:
- **Obesity_Insufficient_Weight**
- **Obesity_Normal_Weight**
- **Obesity_Obesity_Type_I**
- **Obesity_Obesity_Type_II**
- **Obesity_Obesity_Type_III**
- **Obesity_Overweight_Level_I**
- **Obesity_Overweight_Level_II**
  
## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Python**: Data processing and modeling
- **Libraries**: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
